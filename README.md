## MKTG 7011 Case Assignment
Looking at potential target segments based on the main customer base (professional and affluent women, ages 30 to 55, who earn between $100,000 and $250,000 per year in metro cities).
I'm looking at expanding into other metro cities (not on the coast and in middle of the US as described in the case) based on their population numbers and income.
